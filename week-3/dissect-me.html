      Version control is a crucial technology for programmers, especially when working on collaborative projects. It allows for efficient tracking, implementation, and reverting of changes made to a codebase over time.

        Version control is a way for anyone to keep track of all the steps they've taken on a creative project on a computer. "Version control" is particularly popular with programmers, but it's an idea you may have come across as early as elementary school. If you ever had to turn in an outline for a short essay, then turn in a rough draft, and lastly a final version, you essentially broke a task down into parts, had copies of your work on each step, and then completed the task. When you're working on a computer, version control makes it easy to track all your changes on a project. It protects each stage, and lets you reference each change at any point.

      Git is an widely used version control system and was originally created for work on the Linux kernel, one of the most famous open source projects. Git is well known for its speed and efficiency, and its features that allow for many users to collaborate on a project. One of git's most renowned features is its system for leaving messages on "commits" (code changes), which allows collaborators to explain the intention and reasoning behind their work.

      Many git users choose to store their projects on Github. Github is a free git repository hosting service that has many useful tools to promote collaboration between users. Because of these features Github has developed a wide following across the development community, which makes it an appealing place to communicate with colleagues and showcase work. Many well known open source software projects are hosted on Github and developers of all skill levels are active there.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I find <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <article> very helpful for organizing common types of content on a webpage, for example titles, navigation info, sections of text, and blog posts/articles respectively.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out according to their HTML5 semantic tags (or divs in older versions of HTML) and how they interact with the CSS stylesheet if one exists. The browser displays elements in the order they appear in the HTML.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

Sublime is a very powerful programmer's text editor that has a lot of helpful productivity features, which is how they get people to pay $70 for a freeware product. Code snippets will definitely come in handy in the future for adding libraries, etc. and I look forward to checking out more shortcuts at shortcutfoo.com and elsewhere.
