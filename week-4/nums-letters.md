What does puts do?

puts outputs to the console with a newline. It does not return anything.

What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number, ie. does not contain a decimal. Floats do have decimals.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division rounds down to the nearest whole number if there is a remainder, while float division will add on the remainder as a decimal value.

Code challenges

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby uses standard arithmetical operators to handle these, but if variables are integers only integer values will be returned.

What is the difference between integers and floats?

An integer is a whole number, ie. does not contain a decimal. Floats do have decimals. Ruby defaults numeric variables to integers.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division rounds down to the nearest whole number if there is a remainder, while float division will add on the remainder as a decimal value.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are variables that contain text. They are useful for storing text or other types of values you don't want Ruby to treat as numbers.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables specific to a particular function. They are helpful if you want to do an operation on a variable to execute a particular command without assigning the variable a new value throughout the program.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Yes, it was helpful to review the basics, get used to running Ruby scripts and rspec on my local machine, and have some common pitfalls flagged.
