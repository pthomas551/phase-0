# Class Warfare, Validate a Credit Card Number


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode

# Input: 16 digit number (check)
# Output: brokenolean value
# Steps:
# initialize method
# check the number has 16 digits and is integer, raise error if not
# split it up into an array of its individual digits
# reverse and iterate over odd indices,
#   double each digit w odd index
# reverse back
#
# Sum all the untouched digits and the doubled digits (doubled digits need to be broken apart, 10 becomes 1 + 0).
# iterate over array, if n >= 10, add one to digit mod 10
# sum all values in array
#
# check if sum % 10 == 0 if so return true
#
# Initial Solution

# Don't forget to check on initialization for a card length
# of exactly 16 digits

# class CreditCard

#   def initialize(cc_number)
#     @cc_number = cc_number.to_s
#     raise ArgumentError if @cc_number.length != 16
#   end

#   def check_card
#     cc_array = @cc_number.chars
#     cc_array.reverse!

#     cc_array = cc_array.each_with_index.map do |digit, index|
#       if index.odd?
#         digit = digit.to_i * 2
#       else
#         digit = digit.to_i
#       end
#     end

#     cc_total = cc_array.reduce do |sum, digit|
#       sum += 1 if digit >=10
#       sum += digit % 10
#     end

#     if cc_total % 10 == 0; return true
#     else; return false
#     end
#   end

# end



# Refactored Solution

class CreditCard

  def initialize(cc_number)
    @cc_number = cc_number.to_s
    raise ArgumentError if @cc_number.length != 16
  end

  # doubles every even digit of given array (odd indices)
  def double_odd_indexes!(cc_number)
    cc_number.map!.with_index do |digit, index|
      if index.odd?
        digit = digit.to_i * 2
      else
        digit = digit.to_i
      end
    end
  end

  #sums digits of numbers in array
  def total_digits(cc_number)
    cc_number.reduce do |checksum, digit|
      checksum += 1 if digit >=10
      checksum += digit % 10
    end
  end

  #checks to see if card number is valid, returns true or false
  def check_card
    cc_array = @cc_number.chars
    cc_array.reverse!

    double_odd_indexes!(cc_array)

    return true if total_digits(cc_array) % 10 == 0

    false
  end
end

What was the most difficult part of this challenge for you and your pair?

We had some trouble setting up the syntax to ensure the variables were stored correctly between steps and were converted to the proper state.

What new methods did you find to help you when you refactored?

We didn't learn new methods so much as we learned more about chaining Enumerable methods to make code more efficient - for example, chaining with_index after map! to combine both methods.

What concepts or learnings were you able to solidify in this challenge?

It was very helpful to have some more experience with Enumerable methods and to learn a bit about using the Enumerator object.
