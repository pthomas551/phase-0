// User stories
// As a user, I want to start with two separate series of numbers, one with an odd number of elements and an even number of elements respectively.
// Then I want to be able to select either of the series of numbers and calculate the sum,
// mean,
// and median of the values contained within.
// These operations should be carried out separately from one another (i.e. not done all at once.)
