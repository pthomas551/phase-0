<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I have done this many time before but usually in a CMS so it was good to remind myself of the full structure of an HTML page and get used to the new HTML5 convnetions.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I didn't really use them for this iteration of the site but it was good to research them for future use.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Reasonably good but there were some cases where it was unavoidable (eg. br/ tags)

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is easy to get the hang of but it is also very easy to write bad HTML if you're not careful.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I think it's good to try to avoid using WYSIWIG HTML editors when there's an option to edit raw HTML on web forms, CMS's, etc. so you get used to seeing it.
