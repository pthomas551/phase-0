What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

1. Information Gathering - get info on customer, audience, and scope of project
2. Planning - develop sitemap and decide on core technologies (eg. CMS)
3. Design - create site mockup and iterate w/ customer and/or audience input
4. Development - create functional homepage, write HTML/CSS, install CMS/other extensions, populate with content

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The site's primary goal will be developing and maintaining a professional brand. To this extent it will contain useful professional content such as a resume, professional blog, relevant projects, social media links, etc.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The target audience will be potential employers and people interested in my work. It will provide easy access to relevant content for these audiences as described above.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

They should have options to view my resume/portfolio, interact with me on social media, or contact me directly.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design and UX are often seen as a costly distraction, but they can make a huge difference in the success of a project. Quality design is critical since it is design that mediates the interaction between a product's features and the user. Poor design means the user cannot make full use of the product. When translated to web development this means that design makes the difference between a site meeting or failing to meet its goals (pageviews, sales, etc.)

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

UX design is the management of user interactions with and reactions to a system. It is a more holistic perspective on usability design which solely focuses on user interactions with specific elements of a system.UX design is valuable because it puts the user's priorities first (that is, ahead of the client or designer's priorities.)

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I did not really find any parts of the challenge tedious, although it is the case that most people's professional homepages will probably have very similar design goals and elements..
